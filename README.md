- **GSAP**: JavaScript library for animations.

## Features

- **Transitions**: Smooth transitions between different sections of the landing page.
- **Scroll Animations**: Elements animate as the user scrolls down the page.

Feel free to modify the `script.js` file to experiment with different GSAP animation effects.
